## Acknowledgements

This project is based on the original work by [MulongXie](https://github.com/MulongXie/UIED). Modifications were made to improve image quality and add element labeling functionality for Gemini Vision.
Here's an optimized version of your README file, along with answers to your questions:

### Project Overview

The `element_detection` directory is a clone of the GitHub repository [UIED](https://github.com/MulongXie/UIED). I have made several modifications to improve its functionality.

### Changes Made

1. **Image Quality**: Preserved the quality and size of the images in the output.
2. **Element Labeling**: Added labels to elements, enabling Gemini Vision to interact (click) with these elements.

## What is it?

UI Element Detection (UIED) is an old-fashioned computer vision (CV) based element detection approach for graphic user interface.

The input of UIED could be various UI image, such as mobile app or web page screenshot, UI design drawn by Photoshop or Sketch, and even some hand-drawn UI design. Then the approach detects and classifies text and graphic UI elements, and exports the detection result as JSON file for future application.
